A file can contains n number of classes.
A class has properties(what class has), actions (what class can do)
Ex: class Dog
fields/ properties: name, breed, weight, height
Actions: barking(), eating(), eating()

Primitive and object difference?
Int a=4;            a=4
Int b=a; 	b=4
Int c=b; 	c=4
Even though all the three variables are having the same value, separate copy will br created.
In object:     Car a=new Car();
	        b=a;     c=b;           // all the three references will point to the same object.
a.name=”Tata”;
b.name=”BMW”;
sop(a.name);		//BMW
sop(b.name);		//BMW

When object is created for the class, all its properties will be assigned with default values.

Fields (variables, methods) inside the method are local variable and they must be initialized before its usage.
Fields (variable, ,methods ) inside class and outside the method are called instance variable and they have default values.
Constructor is a special type of method having the same class name and no return type.
It executes when the object is created.

Instance variables can be located any order before its usage,because the compiler will rearrange them to the top, so issue will be arised.
But it is not the case with local variables.

Only static variables and methods can be used inside the static method.
If a method or variable is to be accessed inside the static method, it should be either static or it should be called using the object name.

Java will provide default constructor only when user doesn’t create any constructor at all.

This keyword is used to access the current instance of the class.
