Using this(p1,p2), we can call other constructors from one constructor.
Constructor with different parameters is called constructor overloading.
Recursive constructor call is not allowed: 
Ex:   1.    Main(int a, int b){
	this(“name”);
}

2.  Main(String res){
this(12,13);
sop(“-------”)
sop(“---------”)
}
1 to 2, 2 to 1, 1 to 2…..continues………………….


When we are  calling a constructor from another constructor, that should be the first time.

Main(int a){}

Main(int a, int b){}

Main(String res){
this(12,13);
sop(“-------”)
sop(“---------”)
}
The code inside the static block gets executed only once when the class loads. 
Even before the constructor call, the static block is executed.
