ArrayList and Vector:
Both uses dynamic array.

Differences between arraylist and vector:
ArrayList: 
Not synchronized
Faster
Better in single threaded environment.
increases by 50% when capacity becomes full.

Vector: 
Synchronized
Slower
Better in multi threaded environment.
doubled  when capacity is full

Not synchronized: multiple threads canâ€™t operate on a single data.
